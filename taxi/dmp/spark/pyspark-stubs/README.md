# PySpark Stubs

A collection of the Apache Spark [stub files](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#stub-files). These files were generated by [stubgen](https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/mypy/stubgen.py) and manually edited to include accurate type hints.

Tests and configuration files have been originally contributed to the [Typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed/). Please refer to its [contributors list](https://github.com/python/typeshed/graphs/contributors) and [license](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/LICENSE) for details.

## Usage

According to [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#storing-and-distributing-stub-files): 

> Third-party stub packages can use any location for stub storage. Type checkers should search for them using PYTHONPATH. 

Adding `third_party/3` to the `PYTHONPATH` seems to the trick.
